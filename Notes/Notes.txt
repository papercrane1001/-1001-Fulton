-Init-
Here's what I think needs to happen.  I need an apparel with an ability with a set number of charges.  I can look into refueling later; I think VWE Grenades would be a good place to look.  That being said, I don't want it to rely on VWE:G.  Vanilla Expanded Framework is fine by me, though
The ability should prompt the launch of the downed enemy.  Animation cna be a transport pod for now, or just the pawn flying upwards for max silliness.  
What I'm not sure of yet is how the enemy should be received.  They could have a drop spot like VE:Outposts, or they could select a landing point like VVE...
Or they could just trigger a custom downed pod event.  That might actually work in terms of balance.
