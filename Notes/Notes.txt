-Init-
Here's what I think needs to happen.  I need an apparel with an ability with a set number of charges.  I can look into refueling later; I think VWE Grenades would be a good place to look.  That being said, I don't want it to rely on VWE:G.  Vanilla Expanded Framework is fine by me, though
The ability should prompt the launch of the downed enemy.  Animation cna be a transport pod for now, or just the pawn flying upwards for max silliness.  
What I'm not sure of yet is how the enemy should be received.  They could have a drop spot like VE:Outposts, or they could select a landing point like VVE...
Or they could just trigger a custom downed pod event.  That might actually work in terms of balance.

Rethinking the grenades approach, now looking into Tunneler's smokepop ability.  I'd prefer the vanilla Rimworld methods after all.

Okay, I figured out how to do it the way I wanted to, but I'd have to redo a bunch of stuff.  Instead, I want to use Tynan's verbs, since I can ride on the "AbilityTouchBase" base.  

I'm going to ask the Discord for help


I was basing things off of the Jump Packs

The jump packs aren't abilities either.
They use an apparel verb
Only the Biotech jump abilities are actual abilities

Okay, so I can scrap the Ability research and focus on the Verbs.  That's something.  Thanks!

Mind you, there's a lot of good reasons to use AbilityDefs, I'm just saying that so far vanilla hasn't used them on apparel
the apparel verbs are good if you want them to be fueled and such
apparel verbs are used for jump packs, smokepop and tox packs, psychic lances, and the armor weapons from royalty like the phoenix and grenadier marine armors
AbilityDefs have a lot more flexibility in what they can do and are useful for independent cooldowns rather than fueled systems
I will say that vanilla is likely using AbilityDefs for the special weapons that are coming in Anomaly and we've largely managed to reverse-engineer how that works, but that has its own issues
